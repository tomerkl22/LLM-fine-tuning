In this notebook we'll walk through the process of fine-tuning one of OpenAI's advanced language models on the [MTSamples](https://mtsamples.com/) dataset.

LLM fine-tuning with medical data by OpenAI enhances the model's proficiency in understanding and generating medical content, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, researchers, and students.

Preprocessed the data, splitting it into train, test, validation sets. checked the token cost. Used OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo for fine-tuning and visualized the loss using Matplotlib library.

Finally, I compared the results of the fine-tuned model with the base GPT-3.5-turbo model.
